The blog tasks gives you the opportunity to report and keep up on ongoing events related to security and privacy. Once a term you are supposed to report on a current event. 

You should detail:
* what exactly the event was, 
* what caused it, and 
* who was affected. 
* If you report on a privacy or security breach, explain methods to prevent future similar breaches. 

While the main part of our report should be objective, you are encouraged to state your opinion in a closing statement. Afterwards, you will lead an online discussion with other students about your chosen topic. You are supposed to participate in the discussion of other blogs. Your grade for the blog task is 70% your blog and 30% your discussion participation. Make sure to:
